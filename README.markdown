# Thermometers

I had a pet project a while back involving 1wire devices from what was then
Dallas Semiconductor.  I still use the devices I've got and my
[ibutton](http://github.com/dustin/ibutton) tree is the lowest-level of the
stack.

This project consists of tools that sit on a LAN along with my multicast
collector and produces pictures like this one of my house:

![My House](http://bleu.west.spy.net/house/ "My House")

It also makes individual thermometer pictures like this one from my
living room:
